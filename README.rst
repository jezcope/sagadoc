Saga: Generate documents from data and code.

Sága_ is a Norse godess of wisdom. "Saga" also means a long story (also originally from Norse mythology). It allows you to load some data, optionally process that data with a Python script, and then format the result as a document.

It currently expects input files to be in YAML format (for data) and Python (for code), though this may expand in the future. Templates are written using Jinja2, but no restrictions are made on the output format other than it being some form of plain text. Markdown, HTML and LaTeX should all work.
